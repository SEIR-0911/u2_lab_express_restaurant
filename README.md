## Introduction

Now that we have our Express code built up, creating new routes with controllers to display JSON Data, lets render some information out and see how it will look as we take it to the next step attaching Mongoose to express.

For this lab, lets create a back end server that renders data for a mock restaurant, detailing different types of cuisine, with JSON objects of the restaurant's dishes

## Requirements

- An Express Server with Index and Show routes for at least 3 different data models - Appetizers, Entrees, and Desserts
- At least 3 objects within each Index Route
- The ability to show an individual object by its Id in the route
- A controller attached to each route to keep our code clean, modular, and DRY
- There is no limit to what you can do with each, but take some time to think of what your data should look like - Name? Price? An Image URL? How about booleans for things like Vegan, Gluten Free, Kosher, Halal...
